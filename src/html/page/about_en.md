Mindong Lab is a group of open-source volunteers. 

Our aim is using Software Engineering to preserve Easter Min (Mindong), which is a Chinese varient spoken in southeastern China.

We hope to provide tools for learners and researchers of Easter Min.

Our goals:
 - Support our mother tongue; promote linguistic diversity
 - Use the power of the crowd; work as a community
