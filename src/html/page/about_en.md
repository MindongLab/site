Mindong Lab is a group of open-source volunteers. 

Our aim is using Software Engineering to preserve Eastern Min (Mindong), which is a Chinese variant spoken in Southeast China.

We hope to provide tools for learners and researchers of Eastern Min.

Our goals:
 - Support our mother tongue; promote linguistic diversity
 - Use crowdsourcing; work as a community
